= Using the OneCX Generator
To run the generator, you have to run the following commands

npx @onecx/create-workspace ngrx || angular
We are recommending ngrx.

For your project, there might exist specific generators where @onecx has to be replaced by your project-specific prefix. Please clarify this with your architect.

No manual steps are needed.

As a next step, you can add a feature module ( link: feature module).
in the article: nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:feature [nameOfTheFeature]

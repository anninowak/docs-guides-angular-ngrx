= Create a new OneCX App
If you want to create a new OneCX application, you can choose to do it by your own or to use the generator.

== Using the OneCX Generator
To run the generator, you have to run the following commands

[subs=+macros]
----
npx @onecx/create-workspace ngrx || angular
----
We are recommending ngrx.
For your project, there might exist specific generators where @onecx has to be replaced by your project-specific prefix. Please clarify this with your architect.
